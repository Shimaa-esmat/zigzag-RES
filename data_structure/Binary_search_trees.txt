/*
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: 
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key. 
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
*/

/*
You compare the data in each node with the one you are looking for
If the compared node doesn't match then you either proceed to the right child or the left child
*/

/*
for searching, inserting or deleting 
The time complexity is  O(h)  in case of skewed trees.
space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
