/*
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.
*/

/*
Each element is assigned a key (converted key). 
By using that key you can access the element in O(1) time 
Using the key,hash function computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.

Time complexity and Space Complexity
*************************************************
1-deleting :This method removes a given key from the hash table. 
The time complexity of this method is O(1) because it is constant time. 
The space complexity is O(1) because it does not depend on the amount of items stored in the hash table

2-Inserting :This method adds a key value pair to the hash table. 
The time complexity of this method is O(1) because it is constant time. 
The space complexity is O(n) because it will increase with the amount of items stored in the hash table.

3-Searching:This method returns the value for a given key from the hash table. 
The time complexity of this method is O(1) because it is constant time. 
The space complexity is O(1) because it does not depend on the amount of items stored in the hash table.
